# DDM_Sensor_Simulator
Repository for DDM sensor simulators 

"Part 101"
A Python script is written to easily send continuous sensor data. 
Nothing fancy, basically the standard Post method, put together in a while loop (which is set with 1 second delay and total for 1 minute, but can be very easily modified at the script.Necessary details are to be fed from Gateway tickets and sensor end point identifiers. 

Next improvisation can be to pick token values from the downloaded gateway ticket file itself and put a Django front end.

Feel free to clone, fork, improvise code, add new feature, upload to YOUR own repo and share! 

Cheers, 
Arijit
